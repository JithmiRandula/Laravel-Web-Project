  <h1><strong>Education Website</strong></h1>

  <p>This project is an <strong>Education Website</strong> built with <strong>Laravel (PHP)</strong> for the backend and the <strong>Blade templating engine</strong> for the frontend. The system enables users to perform <strong>CRUD operations</strong> (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on courses, with a strong focus on <strong>user authentication</strong>. This makes it ideal for managing and showcasing educational content or academic courses efficiently.</p>

  <h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Secure registration and login to protect access to course management features.</li>
    <li><strong>Create Courses:</strong> Add new courses with details such as course name, description, duration, and instructor.</li>
    <li><strong>Read Courses:</strong> View a list of all available courses with key details shown in a clean, responsive interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Update Courses:</strong> Edit existing course details using a simple and intuitive form.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete Courses:</strong> Remove outdated or unnecessary courses with one click.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>Usage</strong></h2>
  <p>The Education Website provides a user-friendly interface where the homepage displays a list of all available courses to users. After logging in, authenticated users can navigate to the "Add Course" page to input new course data. They can also edit any course by clicking the "Edit" button on a course card or delete a course using the "Delete" button. Authentication ensures that only registered users have permission to add, edit, or delete courses, while guests are allowed to view the course listings.</p>
