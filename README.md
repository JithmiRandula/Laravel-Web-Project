Education Website
This project is an Education Website built with Laravel (PHP) for the backend and the Blade templating engine for the frontend. The system enables users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on courses, with a strong focus on user authentication. This makes it ideal for managing and showcasing educational content or academic courses efficiently.
